# Lab05
The objective of this Lab is to explore solutions using recursion/stacks, Exceptions, and Templates


## Task 1 Explore relationship between recursion/Stacks

Implement two functions to calculate a factorial of integer number, one using recursion and the other using a stack.

## Task 2 Using the recursive implementation of Queensolver, switch it to use a stack.

Using the recursive implementation for Queensolver.  Switch it to use a stack.

You will need to provide screen shots of just one valid solution of a queen placed on a 8X8 board.  You MUST use a stack.

You can stop after getting a single valid solution.


## Task 3 Exceptions

  * Implement CallSimpleException to return a string of the status of the call to make the unit tests pass.
  * Additionally using  try\catch blocks catch the exceptions to report the error string correct
  * Free the memory of the MyFakeClass appropriately.
  * Add in MyException3
